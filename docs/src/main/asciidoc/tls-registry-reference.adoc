The TLS registry is a Quarkus extension centralizing the TLS configuration for the application.
It allows to define the TLS configuration in a single place and to reference it from multiple places in the application.

The TLS extension should be automatically added to your project as soon as you use a compatible extension.
For example, if your application uses Quarkus REST, gRPC or reactive routes, the TLS registry is automatically added to your project.

== Examples

To configure a TLS connection, and more specifically the key stores and trust stores, you use the `quarkus.tls.*` properties.

Configuration directly under `quarkus.tls` is the default configuration that will be used by all the TLS connections in the application.
However, you can also have specific configurations for specific connections by using the `quarkus.tls.<name>.*` properties.

=== Configure the HTTP server to use https://

To configure the HTTP server to use HTTPS, you can use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.key=server.key
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

So you a `p12` (PKCS12) key store, use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

Instead of the default configuration, you can use a named configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=https
----

=== Configure a client to use https://

As an example to illustrate client configuration, we will use a gRPC client:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=grpc-client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true
----

=== Configuring mTLS

To configure mTLS, you need to configure both the server and the client.
Both will receive a key store and a trust store:

- the server key store contains the server certificate and private key
- the client key store contains the client certificate and private key
- the server trust store contains the client certificate (to authenticate the client)
- the client trust store contains the server certificate (to authenticate the server)

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-server-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.tls-configuration-name=my-client
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true

quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=REQUIRED # Enable mTLS
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=my-server
quarkus.grpc.server.use-separate-server=false
quarkus.grpc.server.plain-text=false
----

== Referencing a TLS configuration

Once you have configured a _named_ configuration using `quarkus.tls.<name>`, you need to reference it.
This is done using the `tls-configuration-name` property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.password=secret

quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=https # Reference the named configuration
----

== Configuring TLS

Configuring TLS is mainly about key stores and trust stores.
The configuration depends on the format (`pem`, `p12`, `jks`...).
There are other important properties too.
This section details the various properties you can use to configure TLS.

=== Key stores

Key stores are used to store the private key and the certificate.
They are mainly used on the server-side, but can also be used on the client-side when mTLS is used.

==== PEM key stores

PEM key stores are composed of a list of pair of two files: the certificate and the private key.
The certificate file is a `.crt` or `.pem` file, and the private key file is often a `.key` file.

To configure a PEM key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.key=server.key
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.cert=my-second-cert.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.key=my-second-key.key
----

In general, you will only need one pair of certificate and private key.
The certificate may contain multiple certificates (a chain), but there should be one private key.

When multiple pairs are configured, the selection is done using SNI (Server Name Indication).
The client will send the server name it wants to connect to, and the server will select the appropriate pair of certificate and private key.
Make sure xref:./tls-registry-reference.adoc#sni[SNI] is enabled on both the client and server to use this feature.

IMPORTANT: When configuring multiple key/cert pairs, the order is following the lexicographical order of the name (`a` and `b` in the previous snippet). So, the first pair is the one with the lowest lexicographical order. You can define the order by using the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order` property, for example: `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order=b,c,a`. This is important when using SNI, as the first pair is the default one.

==== PKCS12 key stores

PKCS12 key stores are a single file containing the certificate and the private key.
To configure a PKCS12 key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the key store.
Also, they can include more than one certificate and private key.
In this case, you can:

- either provide the alias of the certificate and private key you want to use
- or use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key (all keys must use the same password)

To configure the alias, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias-password=my-alias-password
----

==== JKS key stores

JKS key stores are a single file containing the certificate and the private key.
Note that the JKS format should be avoided as it is less secure than PKCS12.
To configure a JKS key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the key store.
Also, they can include more than one certificate and private key.
In this case, you can:

- either provide the alias of the certificate and private key you want to use
- or use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key (all keys must use the same password)

To configure the alias, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias-password=my-alias-password
----

[#sni]
==== SNI

Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension that allows a client to specify the hostname it is attempting to connect to during the TLS handshake.
It enables a server to present different TLS certificates for multiple domains on a single IP address, facilitating secure communication for virtual hosting scenarios.

To enable SNI, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.sni=true # Disabled by default
----

With this setting enabled, the client indicate the server name during the TLS handshake, allowing the server to select the right certificate:

- When configuring the keystore with PEM files, multiple CRT/Key must be given.
- When configuring the keystore with a JKS or a P12 file, it selects one alias based on the SNI hostname. In this case, all the keystore password and alias password must be the same. Do not set the `alias` property in this case.

==== Credential providers

Instead of passing the key store password and alias password in the configuration, you can use a credential provider.

A credential provider offers a way to retrieve the key store password and alias password.
Note that the credential provider is only used if the password / alias password are not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider, use the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the key store password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password

# The key used to retrieve the alias password, `alias-password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.alias-password-key=alias-password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS key stores.

=== Trust stores

Trust stores are used to store the certificates of the trusted parties.
They are generally used on the client-side, and on the server-side when mTLS is used.

==== PEM trust stores

PEM trust stores are composed of a list of `.crt` or `.pem` files.
Each of them contains a certificate.

To configure a PEM trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.pem.certs=ca.crt,ca2.pem
----

==== PKCS12 trust stores

PKCS12 trust stores are a single file containing the certificates.
When multiple certificates are included, you can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate.

To configure a PKCS12 trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.path=client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.alias=my-alias
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the trust store.
However, unlike for key stores, the alias does not require a password (because it's the public certificate and not a private key).

==== JKS trust stores

JKS trust stores are a single file containing the certificates.
When multiple certificates are included, you can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate.
Note that the JKS format should be avoided as it is less secure than PKCS12.

To configure a JKS trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.alias=my-alias
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the trust store.
However, unlike for key stores, the alias does not require a password (because it's the public certificate and not a private key).

==== Credential providers

Instead of passing the trust store password in the configuration, you can use a credential provider.

A credential provider offers a way to retrieve passwords and other credentials.
Note that the credential provider is only used if the password is not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider, use the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the trust store password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS trust stores.

=== Other properties

While key stores and trust stores are the most important properties, there are other properties you can use to configure TLS.

NOTE: while the following examples use the _default_ configuration, you can use the _named_ configuration by prefixing the properties with the name of the configuration.

==== Cipher suites

The cipher suites are the list of ciphers that can be used during the TLS handshake.
You can configure the ordered list of enabled cipher suites.
If not configured, a reasonable default is selected from the built-in ciphers.
However, when configured, it takes precedence over the default suite defined by the SSL engine in use.

To configure the cipher suites, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.cipher-suites=TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
----

==== TLS Protocol versions

The TLS protocol versions are the list of protocols that can be used during the TLS handshake.
You can configure the ordered list of enabled TLS protocols.
If not configured , it defaults to `TLSv1.3`, `TLSv1.2`.

Are supported: `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`.

To only enable `TLSv1.3`, configure the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.protocols=TLSv1.3
----

==== Handshake timeout

When a TLS connection is established, the handshake phase is the first step.
During this phase, the client and server exchange information to establish the connection, typically the cipher suite, the TLS protocol version, the certification validation and so on.

To configure the timeout for the handshake phase, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.handshake-timeout=10S # Default.
----

==== ALPN

Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a TLS extension that allows the client and server during the TLS handshake to negotiate which protocol they will use for communication.
ALPN enables more efficient communication by allowing the client to indicate its preferred application protocol to the server before the TLS connection is established.

This helps in scenarios such as HTTP/2 where multiple protocols may be available, allowing for faster protocol selection.

ALPN is enabled by default.
To disable it, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.alpn=false
----

==== Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) before their scheduled expiration date.
When a certificate is compromised, no longer needed, or deemed invalid for any reason, the CA adds it to the CRL to inform relying parties not to trust the certificate anymore.

You can configure the CRL with the list of certificate files you do not trust anymore.
Two formats are allowed: DER and PKCS#7 (also known as P7B).

* When using the DER format, you must pass DER-encoded CRLs.
* When using the PKCS#7 format, you must pass PKCS#7 `SignedData` object, with the only significant field being `crls`.

To configure the CRL, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.certificate-revocation-list=ca.crl, ca2.crl
----

==== Trusting all certificates and hostname verification

IMPORTANT: These two properties should not be used in production.

You can configure your TLS connection to trust all certificates and to disable the hostname verification.
These are two different steps:

- trusting all certificates ignores the certificate validation, so all certificates are trusted. It is useful for testing with self-signed certificates, but should not be used in production.
- hostname verification is the process of verifying the server's identity. It is useful to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. It often defaults to `HTTPS` or `LDAPS`.

To trust all certificates, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-all=true
----

To disable the hostname verification, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.hostname-verification-algorithm=NONE
----

=== Configuration reference

The following table lists the supported properties:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-tls.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

== The registry API

While extensions will automatically use the TLS registry, you can also use the registry API to access the TLS configuration programmatically.

To access the TLS configuration, inject the `TlsConfigurationRegistry` bean and gets the TLS configuration by name (or the default one):

[source,java]
----
 @Inject
 TlsConfigurationRegistry certificates;
// ...
TlsConfiguration def = certificates.getDefault().orElseThrow();
TlsConfiguration named = certificates.get("name").orElseThrow();
//...
----

The `TlsConfiguration` object contains the key stores, trust stores, cipher suites, protocols, and other properties.
It also provides a way to create an `SSLContext` from the configuration.

As Vert.x is omnipresent in Quarkus, you can also use the `TlsConfiguration` object to configure the Vert.x client or server such as `KeyCertOptions`, `TrustOptions`, and so on.

== Registering a certificate from an extension

This section is only for extension developers.
An extension can register a certificate in the TLS registry.
This is useful when an extension needs to provide a certificate to the application or provides a different format.

To achieve this, the extension _processor_ must produce a `TlsCertificateBuildItem`.
A `TlsCertificateBuildItem` is composed of a name and a `CertificateSupplier`.

[source,java]
----
TlsCertificateBuildItem item = new TlsCertificateBuildItem("named",
    new MyCertificateSupplier());
----

The certificate supplier is a runtime object that is generally retrieved using a recorder method.
Here is an example of a certificate supplier:

[source,java]
----
public class MyCertificateSupplier implements Supplier<TlsConfiguration> {

        @Override
        public TlsConfiguration get() {
            try {
                KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ks.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-keystore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                KeyStore ts = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ts.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-truststore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                return new BaseTlsConfiguration() {
                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getKeyStore() {
                        return ks;
                    }

                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getTrustStore() {
                        return ts;
                    }
                };
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
----

== Startup checks

When the application starts, the TLS registry performs some checks to ensure the configuration is correct:

- the key stores and trust stores are accessible
- the aliases are available and accessible in the key stores and trust stores
- the certificates are valid
- the cipher suites and protocols are valid
- the CRLs are valid

If any of these checks fail, the application will fail to start.
